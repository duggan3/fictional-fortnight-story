The student was about to leave the library for the first of his two exams.
He had been studying for 3 straight hours and felt fully prepared for each of
them. He didn't even want to think about the project he had due the next day.
He just wanted to focus on his exams. On his wait out the door, he got that
gut-wrenching feeling that he had forgotten something. Five seconds later, it
hit him: he had forgotten about the math homework that was due at midnight.

The student stops his step, and stands still thinking about what he should do.
Two minnutes later, he decides to go back to the library.
